[FLEX (Flipboard Explorer)](https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX) is a set of in-app debugging and exploration tools for iOS development. When presented, FLEX shows a toolbar that lives in a window above your application. From this toolbar, you can view and modify nearly every piece of state in your running application.

fleXD is my own personal fork of the original FLEX framework. I'd been using FLEX heavily during my time at Instagram, and it was absolutely indispensible when working on the [Instagram for iPad](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-for-ipad) project. That being said, the toolbar's edge-to-edge design felt quite strange on large iPad screens, and in general, the look of the framework has slowly started to show its age, especially now that iOS 26 has arrived.

Since I had a very different vision of how I think FLEX should look and feel in 2026, instead of barging in and submitting an absolute mountain of PRs to the original repo that might blindside *many* users, I thought I'd keep things separate for now so I can experiment at my own leisure. But I'm certainly open to submitting these changes back upstream if there's demand!

In any case, feel free to play with this version and let me know what you think!

## Features of FLEX
- Inspect and modify views in the hierarchy.
- See the properties and ivars on any object.
- Dynamically modify many properties and ivars.
- Dynamically call instance and class methods.
- Observe detailed network request history with timing, headers, and full responses.
- Add your own simulator keyboard shortcuts.
- View system log messages (e.g. from `NSLog`).
- Track live `NSNotificationCenter` observers and spot ones left registered after deallocation.
- Access any live object via a scan of the heap.
- View the file system within your app's sandbox.
- Browse SQLite/Realm databases in the file system.
- Trigger 3D touch in the simulator using the control, shift, and command keys.
- Explore all classes in your app and linked systems frameworks (public and private).
- Quickly access useful objects such as `[UIApplication sharedApplication]`, the app delegate, the root view controller on the key window, and more.
- Dynamically view and modify `NSUserDefaults` values.

Unlike many other debugging tools, FLEX runs entirely inside your app, so you don't need to be connected to LLDB/Xcode or a different remote debugging server. It works well in the simulator and on physical devices.


## Usage

In the iOS simulator, you can use keyboard shortcuts to activate FLEX. `f` will toggle the FLEX toolbar. Hit the `?` key for a full list of shortcuts. You can also show FLEX programmatically:

Short version:

```objc
// Objective-C
[[FLEXManager sharedManager] showExplorer];
```

```swift
// Swift
FLEXManager.shared.showExplorer()
```

More complete version:

```objc
#if DEBUG
#import "FLEXManager.h"
#endif

...

- (void)handleSixFingerQuadrupleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapRecognizer
{
#if DEBUG
    if (tapRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized) {
        // This could also live in a handler for a keyboard shortcut, debug menu item, etc.
        [[FLEXManager sharedManager] showExplorer];
    }
#endif
}
```

## Installation

fleXD requires an app that targets iOS 15 or higher. To run the Example project, simply open the Xcode project in the Example folder. The project will import the local copy of FLEX automatically via Swift Pacakage Manager.

### Swift Package Manager

Include the dependency in the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`

``` swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/TimOliver/fleXD.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "6.0.0"))
]
```

Next, include the library in your target:

```js
.target(
    name: "YourDependency",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "FLEX", package: "fleXD")
    ]
)
```

### CocoaPods

Add fleXD to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`:

```ruby
pod 'fleXD'
```

> Until fleXD is published to CocoaPods trunk, reference it directly from git:
> ```ruby
> pod 'fleXD', :git => 'https://github.com/TimOliver/FLEXD.git', :tag => '6.1.0'
> ```

Remember to exclude fleXD from your Release (App Store) builds — see [below](#excluding-flex-from-release-app-store-builds).

## Excluding FLEX from Release (App Store) Builds

FLEX exposes the internals of your app to anyone holding the device, and it relies on many private APIs — shipping it to the App Store risks rejection and is forbidden by the license. Only link it into Debug builds, and make sure every call to it compiles out of Release builds.

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods can handle both automatically by restricting the pod to the Debug configuration:

```ruby
pod 'fleXD', :configurations => ['Debug']
```

### Swift Package Manager

Swift Package Manager has no way to restrict a dependency to a single build configuration, so wrap everything that touches FLEX in `#if DEBUG`:

```swift
#if DEBUG
import FLEX
#endif

func showDebugMenu() {
    #if DEBUG
    FLEXManager.shared.showExplorer()
    #endif
}
```

This compiles all of your FLEX usage out of Release builds, but Xcode will still *link* the framework into them. If you need your production binary completely free of FLEX, use the CocoaPods configuration above, or only add the package product to a separate target (or white-labeled app variant) that never ships.

### Manual

Manually add the files in `Classes/` to your Xcode project, or just drag in the entire `FLEX/` folder. Be sure to exclude FLEX from `Release` builds or your app will be rejected.

##### Silencing warnings

Add the following flags to  to **Other Warnings Flags** in **Build Settings:** 

- `-Wno-deprecated-declarations`
- `-Wno-strict-prototypes`
- `-Wno-unsupported-availability-guard`


## Excluding FLEX from Release (App Store) Builds

FLEX makes it easy to explore the internals of your app, so it is not something you should expose to your users. Fortunately, it is easy to exclude FLEX files from Release builds. The strategies differ depending on how you integrated FLEX in your project, and are described below.

Wrap the places in your code where you integrate FLEX with an `#if DEBUG` statement to ensure the tool is only accessible in your `Debug` builds and to avoid errors in your `Release` builds. For more help with integrating FLEX, see the example project.

### Swift Package Manager

In Xcode, navigate to `Build Settings > Build Options > Excluded Source File Names`. For your `Release` configuration, set it to `FLEX*` like this to exclude all files with the `FLEX` prefix:

### FLEX files added manually to a project

In Xcode, navigate to `Build Settings > Build Options > Excluded Source File Names`. For your `Release` configuration, set it to `FLEX*` like this to exclude all files with the `FLEX` prefix:

<img width=75% height=75% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8371943/70281926-e21d1c00-1781-11ea-92eb-aee340791da8.png>

## Additional Notes

- When setting fields of type `id` or values in `NSUserDefaults`, FLEX attempts to parse the input string as `JSON`. This allows you to use a combination of strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. If you want to set a string value, it must be wrapped in quotes. For ivars or properties that are explicitly typed as `NSStrings`, quotes are not required.
- You may want to disable the exception breakpoint while using FLEX. Certain functions that FLEX uses throw exceptions when they get input they can't handle (i.e. `NSGetSizeAndAlignment()`). FLEX catches these to avoid crashing, but your breakpoint will get hit if it is active.

## Why the name fleXD?

Pronounced 'Flecks-Dee'.

I figured I needed some differentiator from the name FLEX, but FLEX is already such a great name that I didn't want to stray too far from it. I had noticed that a lot of the names in the library love to use puns. The sample app is called FLExample, and there is a file named FLExtensions in there as well.

My favourite millienial emoji is 'XD', the sometimes cheesy cheeky grin emoji. And so, this library is named after that. XD
